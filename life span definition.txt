Claude, we are implementing a new parameter into the voice, it will be called the Life Span parameter.  It will control when during Preview and Play the voice actually sounds.  Life Span controls are effectively a programmable time based mute/unmute switch for the Voice.

Before you decide how to do it:

QUESTION 1:  Let me draw your attention to the row setup for the DELAY parameter.  Should we:

A)  Use the same definition for the LIFE SPAN parameter that the DELAY parameter uses, which is a triple dual slider layout in a correctly sized container, then a Behavior slider container BUT form a special case for LIFE SPAN parameter in the createBehaviorSliders that 1) omits a behavior slider and 2) replace it with a Repeat flag, or 

B) Create a new row definition called 'life-span' and build it to order, modeling on the Delay parameters container definitions?  Ultimately, the new Life Span parameter should have the look and feel of the DELAY parameter row, but omitting the behavior slider and putting a Repeat flag into the same space.

QUESTION 2:  explain how the entire new parameter would work, this is so I can know how it is going to plug in and function within the app code.

Let's get all the questions asked and answered so you completely know the ins and outs of this task, then I would like to ask you to reprint the entire scripts file with the new design integrated.

The definition of the new Life Span parameter is below. Do you see any problems with it?


LIFE SPAN DEFINITION

•	Life Span parameter has three dual slider controls and a checkbox.  
o	The sliders are labeled Life Span 1, Life Span 2, and Life Span 3.  
o	The checkbox is labeled Repeat 
•	Each Life Span slider has its own Enter and Exit time slider, so you can adjust when the voice begins to play, how long it play, when it stops playing, and whether the voice repeats from the beginning again.

The page load defaults are:

Life Span 1
•	Enter = 0 (to start immediately when Play is pressed)
•	Exit = Infinity (the maximum allowed setting) 
•	 Repeat = false
Life Span 2
•	Enter = 0 
•	Exit = 0 (effectively disabling the control) 
•	Repeat = false
Life Span 3
•	Enter = 0 
•	Exit = 0 (effectively disabling the control) 
•	Repeat = false

o   Use Cases:  
•	Set Enter=0 & Exit = Infinity, and repeat=true, and the voice can be expected to start when Play is pressed and play continuously until Stop button is pressed.
•	Set Enter=1m & Exit = 4m, and repeat=false, and the voice can be expected to start one minutes after the Play is pressed and play continuously four minutes, and stop.
•	Set Life Span 1’s Enter=immediately & Exit=1m, and set Life Span 2’s Enter=3m & Exit = 4m, and the voice can be expected to begin immediately and play for 1 minute after the Play button is pressed, then stop playing at the 1 minute mark.  The voice will be silent until the clock reaches the 3 minute mark and will play for 1 minute, when it will fall silent again.  
•	If any Life Spans overlap in playing time, the voice simply continues to play.
